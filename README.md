With the world moving towards Machine Learning (ML), automation, and Artificial Intelligence
(AI), it is essential that even defense sector move forward with the latest technology embedded in
it. Enhancing Weapons and Armory with Machine Learning can lead to a huge contribution in the
sector of defense and military.

Conditions in which Armies, Navy and Air force, defend the nations are extreme, and humans
cannot reach each and every place, so we make use of drones (/other unmanned vehicles). Now,
if these drones not only just had a camera fed into it, but also that camera was powered by ML
and AI, it could improve its purpose by many folds. So, here, in our final semester, we have done
two projects, namely ”Airbus Ship Detection”, and ”Gunshot Audio Classification” as a first step
in learning how ML can help defense sector.

Many a times, under extreme aquatic conditions it becomes difficult to detect ships in the ocean.
We have used Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), in order to detect, and segment ships. We
have used a GAN Pix2Pix algorithm to successfully detect the ships in the ocean. The dataset we
used was taken from Kaggle Competition and consisted of Aerial Images of Water, with the ships
in the images.

In our second project we have classified the Gunshot Audios to their respective classes. For this
we have compared the performance of various ML techniques. The dataset used, consisted of 8
different Guns, with approximately 70-100 audios in each class.

Both of our projects are done, keeping in mind to enhance, and improve the technology in the
defense sector. Thus making a job of army a bit easier.
